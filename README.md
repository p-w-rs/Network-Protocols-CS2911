# CS2911
Labs for CS2911 Introduction to Network Protocols

* Clone the repository or download it as a zip
* In each lab folder you should find a grader.py file tthat you do not change unless specifically told to in that lab
* The other files are for you to write your implementation
* The inline comments tell you what to do in each code file
* Run `python grader.py` to test "self-grade" your code
* The number of tests passed out of the total will be your grade when you submit
* Upload your folder as a zip file to canvas
* I will download you code, replace grader.py with the original on my computer (in  case you changed it), and run `python grader.py`. The number of tests passed out of the total will be your grade.
