# Python Encodings

In this lab you will implement a series of functions to switch between differentt ways of representing data in python.
These functions or variations on them will be used throughout the course, thus this lab is a foundation you mut understand to do well in later labs.

*  There is only one file you need to change **code.py**
*  It contains a series of functions that can be implemented in any order
*  Feel free to look at the grader.py file to help you understand the required input and return format of each function
*  Ask questions if you get stuck
*  As always work with your friends since two heads are better than one
