# Introduction

Over the course we have discussed various protocols and in specific a large number of application layer protocols.

For this lab you will develop your own application level protocol.

# Requirments

Your protocol must include multiple messages between 2 systems. For instance if we have systems A and B. A must both send and recceive data at least 2 times and likewise for B.

Your protocol must make use of the three different types of data:
1. Receiving data of a preknown length (think of the block size in tftp). 
2. Known length (think of the body of http when content length is defined).
3. Receiving data of unknown length (for example the  body of http  in chunking or the number of headers in http or the filename  length in tftp).

Your protocol can serve any purposse you want.

Your protocol will be developed on top of either UDP or TCP.

Your protocol can be encrypted or plain.

You may work in a groups, if you plan to work in a group please send me the names of the people in your group.

# Submission

You will create a 5-10 minute presentation that describes your protocol.

You will record your team giving this presentation and then upload it to youtube.

You will then submit the youtube link on Canvas.
